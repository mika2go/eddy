# eddy

A fast, minimal image and video annotation editor for Linux and Windows (Qt 6).

Takes an image or video from a file (images also support stdin), lets you annotate it, then outputs the result to the clipboard, a file, stdout, or the Boltsnap shelf. Linux keeps the frameless floating workflow; Windows uses native window controls and file dialogs.

## Tools

| Tool | Key | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Move | `M` | Select and reposition any annotation |
| Arrow | `A` | Directional arrow |
| Pen | `P` | Freehand path |
| Rectangle | `R` | Stroked rectangle outline |
| Ellipse | `E` | Stroked ellipse outline |
| Highlight | `H` | Semi-transparent highlight band |
| Text | `T` | Inline text with wrapping, alignment, size, bold and filled-label styles |
| Redact | `X` | Draw a redaction region; a floating mode-bar lets you switch between **Blur / Blacken / OCR-Blur / OCR-Blacken** |
| Spotlight | — | Keep one rounded or oval focus region bright while dimming the surrounding canvas |

Every annotation is a retained scene item — select and move it with the Move tool. Full undo/redo. Crisp anti-aliased rendering via Qt's QGraphicsView.

The toolbar shows **tool icons with tooltips** (tool name + hotkey) — no letter labels.

**Toolbar controls:**

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ↶ / ↷ | Undo / Redo buttons (same as `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`) |
| **S / M / L** | Line-width chooser: 2 px / 4 px / 8 px stroke |
| Colour swatch | Opens a **colour popover** with preset swatches and a *Custom…* entry that opens the full colour dialog |
| Dark / Light | Switches theme immediately and remembers the choice |
| Shelf button | Sends the current edited image to the Boltsnap shelf as a new card |

If the window is made very short, the toolbar **auto-hides** and reappears when the cursor moves to the top edge, keeping the image at full height.

With the **Move tool**, selecting a shape (Rectangle, Ellipse, Highlight, Redact, Spotlight) shows **8 drag handles** to resize it. Selecting an Arrow shows **2 endpoint handles**. Text shows one width handle for wrapping; Pen is move-only.

With the **Text tool**, drag existing text to move it, double-click it to edit, or click empty canvas space to create a new text annotation.

## Usage

```
eddy IMAGE
eddy -f IMAGE
```

`IMAGE` can be `-` to read from stdin.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-f, --file IMAGE` | Input image (`-` = stdin) |
| `-o, --output PATH` | Write PNG to file (`-` = stdout) |
| `--save-dir DIR` | Directory for the in-editor save action |
| `--copy` / `--no-copy` | Copy result to clipboard (default: copy) |
| `--tool NAME` | Start with a specific tool active (e.g. `--tool redact`; legacy `blur`/`pixelate` map to Redact) |
| `--early-exit` | Exit after the first save |
| `--no-anim` | Disable all animations (window fade, smooth zoom, commit fade-in) |
| `--config PATH` | Alternate config file |

swappy-compatible aliases (`-f`, `-o`, `--early-exit`) are supported, so replacing `swappy` with `eddy` in existing keybinds and scripts works without changes.

### Default save behavior

Save uses this priority: explicit `-o` / `--save-dir`, replacement of a supplied Boltsnap card, configured `save_dir`, then shelf return. If `copy_on_save` is enabled, the result is also copied to the clipboard; if Boltsnap is unavailable, Eddy falls back to clipboard copy.

### Pipeline examples

```sh
# Wayland screenshot → eddy
grim -g "$(slurp)" - | eddy -f -

# With boltsnap
boltsnap area --no-copy -o - | eddy -f -
```

## Configuration

`~/.config/eddy/config` — INI format, `[eddy]` group.

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `default_tool` | Tool to activate on start |
| `line_width` | Default stroke width |
| `save_dir` | Default save directory (unset means shelf return) |
| `text_font` | Font for the Text tool |
| `stroke_color` | Default stroke color |
| `early_exit` | Exit after first save (`true`/`false`) |
| `copy_on_save` | Copy to clipboard on save (`true`/`false`) |
| `animations` | Enable window/tool animations (default: `true`) |
| `theme` | `system` (default), `dark`, or `light` |

## Install

Windows releases provide standalone x86-64 MSI and NSIS installers with the
required Qt and compiler runtimes. Download either format from the
[latest Eddy release](https://github.com/drvcvt/eddy/releases/latest). The
Boltsnap Windows installer also includes a compatible Eddy build.

On Linux, build from source with the Qt packages supplied by your distribution.

---

## Build

Requires Qt 6 Widgets, Multimedia, and SVG. Windows additionally uses Qt Network for Boltsnap named-pipe IPC.

```sh
# Debug (default)
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel 3

# Run tests
ctest --test-dir build --parallel 3 --output-on-failure

# Release
cmake -S . -B build-rel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-rel --parallel 3
```

On Windows, configure with a Qt 6 MSVC kit and Visual Studio 2022. Launching
`eddy.exe` without arguments opens the native media picker. Conventional MSI
and NSIS installers can be produced after the Release build with:

```powershell
.\packaging\windows\build-msi.ps1 -BuildDirectory build-win -QtDirectory C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64
.\packaging\windows\build-nsis.ps1 -BuildDirectory build-win -QtDirectory C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64
```

Both installers install Eddy per machine, add a Start-menu shortcut, and register
the classic **Open with Eddy** action. They do not install certificates, MSIX
identity, or Explorer COM extensions. Building the NSIS format requires NSIS 3.

## Known limitations

- **Pen** annotations are move-only; resize handles are not supported for that item type.
